@book{Shi.2015,
 abstract = {This book is mainly about an innovative and fundamental method called ``intelligent knowledge'' to bridge the gap between data mining and knowledge management, two important fields recognized by the information technology (IT) community and business analytics (BA) community respectively. The book includes definitions of the ``first-order'' analytic process, ``second-order'' analytic process and intelligent knowledge, which have not formally been addressed by either data mining or knowledge management. Based on these concepts, which are especially important in connection with the current Big Data movement, the book describes a framework of domain-driven intelligent knowledge discovery. To illustrate its technical advantages for large-scale data, the book employs established approaches, such as Multiple Criteria Programming, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree to identify intelligent knowledge incorporated with human knowledge. The book further shows its applicability by means of real-life data analyses in the contexts of internet business and traditional Chinese medicines},

@book{Garcia.2015,
 abstract = {Data Preprocessing for Data Mining addresses one of the most important issues within the well-known Knowledge Discovery from Data process. Data directly taken from the source will likely have inconsistencies, errors or most importantly, it is not ready to be considered for a data mining process. Furthermore, the increasing amount of data in recent science, industry and business applications, calls to the requirement of more complex tools to analyze it. Thanks to data preprocessing, it is possible to convert the impossible into possible, adapting the data to fulfill the input demands of each data mining algorithm. Data preprocessing includes the data reduction techniques, which aim at reducing the complexity of the data, detecting or removing irrelevant and noisy elements from the data. This book is intended to review the tasks that fill the gap between the data acquisition from the source and the data mining process. A comprehensive look from a practical point of view, including basic concepts and surveying the techniques proposed in the specialized literature, is given.Each chapter is a stand-alone guide to a particular data preprocessing topic, from basic concepts and detailed descriptions of classical algorithms, to an incursion of an exhaustive catalog of recent developments. The in-depth technical descriptions make this book suitable for technical professionals, researchers, senior undergraduate and graduate students in data science, computer science and engineering},

@book{Chu.2014,
 abstract = {The field of data mining has made significant and far-reaching advances over the past three decades. Because of its potential power for solving complex problems, data mining has been successfully applied to diverse areas such as business, engineering, social media, and biological science. Many of these applications search for patterns in complex structural information. In biomedicine for example, modeling complex biological systems requires linking knowledge across many levels of science, from genes to disease. Further, the data characteristics of the problems have also grown from static to dynamic and spatiotemporal, complete to incomplete, and centralized to distributed, and grow in their scope and size (this is known as big data). The effective integration of big data for decision-making also requires privacy preservation. The contributions to this monograph summarize the advances of data mining in the respective fields. This volume consists of nine chapters that address subjects ranging from mining data from opinion, spatiotemporal databases, discriminative subgraph patterns, path knowledge discovery, social media, and privacy issues to the subject of computation reduction via binary matrix factorization.},

@book{Aggarwal.2015,
 abstract = {This textbook explores the different aspects of data mining from the fundamentals to the complex data types and their applications, capturing the wide diversity of problem domains for data mining issues. It goes beyond the traditional focus on data mining problems to introduce advanced data types such as text, time series, discrete sequences, spatial data, graph data, and social networks. Until now, no single book has addressed all these topics in a comprehensive and integrated way. The chapters of this book fall into one of three categories: Fundamental chapters: Data mining has four main problems, which correspond to clustering, classification, association pattern mining, and outlier analysis. These chapters comprehensively discuss a wide variety of methods for these problems. Domain chapters: These chapters discuss the specific methods used for different domains of data such as text data, time-series data, sequence data, graph data, and spatial data. Application chapters: These chapters study important applications such as stream mining, Web mining, ranking, recommendations, social networks, and privacy preservation. The domain chapters also have an applied flavor. Appropriate for both introductory and advanced data mining courses, Data Mining: The Textbook balances mathematical details and intuition. It contains the necessary mathematical details for professors and researchers, but it is presented in a simple and intuitive style to improve accessibility for students and industrial practitioners (including those with a limited mathematical background). Numerous illustrations, examples, and exercises are included, with an emphasis on semantically interpretable examples. Praise for Data Mining: The Textbook - {\grqq}As I read through this book, I have already decided to use it in my classes. ~This is a book written by an outstanding researcher who has made fundamental contributions to data mining, in a way that is both accessible and up to date. ~The book is complete with theory and practical use cases. ~It's a must-have for students and professors alike!{\dq} -- Qiang Yang, Chair of Computer Science and Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology {\dq}This is the most amazing and comprehensive text book on data mining.
